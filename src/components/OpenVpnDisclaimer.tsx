      <p>
        Using OpenVPN certificate management functions requires a solid understanding of VPN security and certificate issuance. 
        <strong> Do not proceed unless you know what you are doing.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ”¹ What are OpenVPN Certificates?</h3>
      <p>
        OpenVPN relies on TLS/SSL certificates for authentication. Each client connecting to an OpenVPN server needs a unique certificate 
        issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ”¹ How are Certificates Issued?</h3>
      <p>
        OpenVPN certificates are typically issued using a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). 
        This process includes generating a Certificate Authority (CA), creating client and server keys, and signing them using the CA.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ”¹ What is EasyRSA?</h3>
      <p>
        EasyRSA is a command-line tool that helps manage OpenVPN certificates and keys. It simplifies the process of creating, revoking, 
        and managing certificates for OpenVPN clients and servers.
      </p>

      <h3>ðŸ”¹ How Certificate Revocation Works</h3>
      <p>
        If a certificate is compromised, it must be revoked. OpenVPN maintains a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), which prevents 
        revoked certificates from being used to connect to the VPN.
